## Deployment Readiness

### Database Infrastructure
- **Working migration system** with `./scripts/migrate.sh`
- **SQLite support** for development and small deployments
- **SeaORM foundation** ready for PostgreSQL scaling
- **Transaction support** for data consistency

### Configuration Management
- **Default configuration** for immediate deployment
- **Environment-based overrides** for container deployment
- **TOML file support** for traditional server deployment
- **Database URL flexibility** supporting multiple connection strings

### Observability
- **Structured logging** with configurable output formats
- **Tracing integration** for request correlation
- **Health check endpoints** preparation in DataStore
- **Statistics gathering** foundation for monitoring

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (Milestone 2)
1. **SNMP Integration** - Build on the DataStore foundation for device polling
2. **Entity Generation** - Complete SQLite DataStore with SeaORM entities
3. **Integration Testing** - Expand test coverage for cross-module interactions

### Technical Debt Management
- **Unused import warnings** in SQLite module (expected - awaiting entity development)
- **Documentation field warnings** for DataStore error types (low priority)
- **Migration enum warnings** (dead code - expected in migration context)

### Scalability Preparation
- **PostgreSQL DataStore** implementation for enterprise deployment
- **Connection pooling optimization** for high-throughput scenarios
- **Caching layer** consideration for frequently accessed data
