   - Alert conditions: GreaterThan, LessThan, Equals, Between, RateOfChange, PercentageChange
   - Severity levels: Info, Low, Medium, High, Critical with proper ordering and string conversion

2. **Multi-Channel Notification System**
   - Email provider with SMTP support and HTML/text message formatting
   - Slack provider with webhook integration and rich message formatting
   - Webhook provider with configurable HTTP endpoints and retry logic
   - PagerDuty provider with incident creation and severity mapping

3. **Escalation Framework**
   - Automated escalation with configurable timeout periods and notification routing
   - Escalation policies with multiple steps and channel assignments
   - Manual escalation triggers and escalation status tracking
   - Background processing with periodic escalation evaluation

4. **Management API**
   - Alert lifecycle management (get, acknowledge, resolve, escalate)
   - Alert rule CRUD operations with validation and configuration management
   - Notification channel management with testing capabilities
   - Escalation policy management and statistics reporting

### Integration Points

- **Metrics System:** Alert rules can be triggered by business metrics from M7.2.2

### Functional Verification

- âœ… Alert rule creation and management API structure
- âœ… Notification provider framework with multiple channel support
- âœ… Escalation engine with automated workflow processing
- âœ… Complete API endpoint coverage for all alerting operations

### Architecture Compliance

- âœ… Follows established Î¼Net patterns and conventions
- âœ… Uses SeaORM patterns for future database integration
- âœ… Implements proper error handling and validation
- âœ… Maintains separation of concerns between core and server components
