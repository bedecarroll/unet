# Documentation Quality Review - 2025-07-02

**Report Time (UTC):** 05:37:05

The documentation was reviewed to assess readiness for open sourcing the project. Significant drift was found between the docs and the actual codebase. The most critical gaps are highlighted below.

## Key Findings

- **Severe Schema Drift**: `02_data_models.md` describes simple UUID-based tables, while the code uses many additional fields, enums, and string types. Numerous tables (`users`, `roles`, `change_management`, etc.) are undocumented.
- **Architecture Mismatch**: `01_architecture.md` and `06_server_backend.md` omit authentication, change management, metrics, and other subsystems implemented in `unet-server`.
- **API Documentation Stale**: The documented route list is a fraction of what exists. Endpoints for templates, git, certificates, network access and metrics are missing.
- **CLI Reference Outdated**: `05_cli_tool.md` lacks many commands such as `config`, `export`, `import`, and most `node` subcommands.
- **TODO Placeholders**: Several files contain lingering TODOs, leaving important sections blank.
- **Missing Contributor Guidance**: There is no clear contribution guide or license header information for external users.

## Recommendations

1. **Rewrite data model documentation** to reflect the current SeaORM entities and migrations.
2. **Expand the architecture and server backend chapters** to cover all major components in the code.
3. **Generate a full API reference** from the Axum routes and keep it versioned.
4. **Update CLI documentation** so every command and flag is covered with examples.
5. **Eliminate TODO placeholders** and provide complete explanations where necessary.
6. **Add a contributor guide and license information** to prepare for community involvement.

These issues must be addressed before promoting the project as production-ready open source software.
