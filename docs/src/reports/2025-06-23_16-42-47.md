### Policy DSL Capabilities

```
# Example policy demonstrating full capabilities
WHEN node.vendor == "cisco" AND node.role == "switch" 
THEN SET custom_data.device_class TO "ios_switch"

WHEN custom_data.device_class == "ios_switch" 
THEN APPLY "templates/cisco-switch.j2"

WHEN node.lifecycle == "live" 
THEN ASSERT custom_data.monitoring.enabled IS true
```
