# Data Model Discrepancy Report - 2025-06-28

This report details the discrepancies found between the data models defined in `02_data_models.md` and the implemented SeaORM entities in the `unet-core` crate.

## General Discrepancies (Applicable to all models)

* **Primary Key Type:**
  * **Documentation:** `UUID`

  * **Documentation:** `i64` (Unix epoch)
  * **Code:** `String`
* **Enums (`Lifecycle`, `LinkRole`):**
  * **Documentation:** Defined as Rust enums.
  * **Code:** Not used. Plain `String` fields are used instead (e.g., `lifecycle: String`).
* **JSON Fields (`custom_data`, `raw_kv`):**
  * **Documentation:** `JsonValue` or `JSON` type.
  * **Code:** `Option<String>` (storing JSON as a string).

## `location` Model

* **Missing Fields (in code):**
  * `lifecycle` (the enum is not used, but a `String` field is also not present)
* **Extra Fields (in code):**
  * `location_type: String`
  * `path: String`
  * `description: Option<String>`
  * `address: Option<String>`
  * `coordinates: Option<String>`

# API Discrepancy Report

This report details the discrepancies found between the API described in the documentation and the implemented API in the `unet-server` crate.

## General Discrepancies

* **API Prefix:** The documentation specifies a `/api/v1` prefix, which is mostly followed, but there are also top-level `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints.
* **Authentication:** The documentation mentions auth as a future feature, but the code has a full-fledged authentication system with JWTs, roles, and permissions.
* **Middleware:** The documentation mentions a few middleware layers, but the code uses a much more extensive set of middleware for security, validation, rate limiting, and more.
* **Error Handling:** The documentation describes a simple `ServerError` enum, but the code has a more complex error handling system with multiple error types and conversions.

## Endpoint Discrepancies

The following is a list of endpoint categories that are present in the code but not mentioned in the documentation:

* **Authentication:** A full suite of endpoints for login, user management, roles, and API keys.
* **Policies:** Endpoints for evaluating, validating, and getting the status of policies.
* **Templates:** A full suite of endpoints for managing templates, including rendering, validation, and usage.
* **Template Assignments:** Endpoints for assigning templates to nodes.
* **Git:** Endpoints for managing the Git repositories, including syncing, viewing changes, and handling webhooks.
* **Change Management:** A full suite of endpoints for managing changes, including approvals, rejections, and rollbacks.
* **Change Notifications:** Endpoints for managing notifications for changes.
* **Certificate Management:** Endpoints for managing TLS certificates.
* **Network Access Control:** Endpoints for managing network access control lists.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** A large number of endpoints for vulnerability scanning (though they are currently commented out).
* **Metrics:** A suite of endpoints for exposing Prometheus metrics and querying system health and performance.

## `node` Endpoint Discrepancies

Even for the `node` endpoints that are mentioned in the documentation, there are discrepancies:

* **`GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/render`:** This endpoint is mentioned in the documentation but is not present in the `server.rs` file.
* **`GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/status`:** This endpoint is not in the documentation but is present in the code.
* **`GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/interfaces`:** This endpoint is not in the documentation but is present in the code.
* **`GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/metrics`:** This endpoint is not in the documentation but is present in the code.

# Task List for API Compliance

This task list is based on the assumption that the documentation is the source of truth.

## General

1. **Update API Prefix:** Move the `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints under the `/api/v1` prefix.
2. **Remove Authentication:** Remove the entire authentication system, including all related endpoints, middleware, and services.
3. **Simplify Middleware:** Remove all middleware except for the `TraceLayer` and `CorsLayer`.
4. **Simplify Error Handling:** Simplify the error handling system to match the `ServerError` enum described in the documentation.

## Endpoints

1. **Remove Extra Endpoints:** Remove all endpoints that are not related to nodes, links, or locations. This includes the endpoints for policies, templates, git, change management, notifications, certificates, network access, vulnerability scanning, and metrics.
2. **Update `node` Endpoints:**
    * Add the `GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/render` endpoint.
    * Remove the `GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/status`, `GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/interfaces`, and `GET /api/v1/nodes/:id/metrics` endpoints.

# CLI Discrepancy Report

This report details the discrepancies found between the CLI described in the documentation and the implemented CLI in the `unet-cli` crate.

## General Discrepancies

* **Top-Level Commands:** The documentation specifies `db`, `completion`, and `version` commands, but the code has `config`, `export`, `import`, and `git` commands instead.
* **`node` Subcommands:** The documentation specifies `add`, `list`, `show`, `update`, `delete`, and `set-lifecycle` subcommands. The code has `add`, `list`, `show`, `update`, and `delete`, but it also has `status`, `monitor`, `metrics`, `compare`, `polling`, and `history`. The `set-lifecycle` subcommand is missing.
* **Offline Mode:** The documentation mentions an offline mode with a `--local` flag, but this is not present in the `nodes.rs` command file.

## `node add` Command Discrepancies

* **Arguments:** The documentation specifies `--name`, `--vendor`, `--model`, `--role`, `--ip`, `--version`, and `--location` arguments. The code has arguments for `name`, `domain`, `vendor`, `model`, `role`, `lifecycle`, `location_id`, `management_ip`, and `custom_data`. The `--version` argument is missing.

## `node list` Command Discrepancies

* **Filtering:** The documentation specifies a `--filter` argument that uses a jq-style expression. The code has separate arguments for filtering by `lifecycle`, `role`, and `vendor`.

## `node show` Command Discrepancies

* **`--eval` flag:** The documentation specifies an `--eval` flag to merge `PolicyResult` fields. This flag is not present in the code. Instead, there are flags for including status, interfaces, and system info.

## `node update` Command Discrepancies

* **`--set` flag:** The documentation specifies a `--set` flag for updating fields. The code has separate arguments for each field that can be updated.

# Task List for CLI Compliance

This task list is based on the assumption that the documentation is the source of truth.

## General

1. **Update Top-Level Commands:**
    * Add the `db`, `completion`, and `version` commands.
    * Remove the `config`, `export`, `import`, and `git` commands.
2. **Update `node` Subcommands:**
    * Add the `set-lifecycle` subcommand.

# Missing Documentation

This section details the features and components that are present in the codebase but are missing from the documentation.

## Outdated or Incomplete Documentation

The existing documentation files describe a much earlier, simpler version of the project.

* **`01_architecture.md` & `06_server_backend.md` (Architecture & Server)**
  * **Missing Components:** The diagrams and component lists completely omit major systems that have been implemented, including:
    * Authentication and Authorization (`AuthService`, JWTs, roles, permissions).
    * Change Management (approval workflows, audit logs, rollbacks).
    * Metrics and Monitoring (`MetricsManager`, Prometheus endpoints).
    * Network Access Control (IP/country-based blocking, rate limiting).
    * Security Auditing and Vulnerability Scanning.
    * TLS Certificate Management.
  * **Incorrect Server Layout:** The documented crate layout in `06_server_backend.md` does not match the actual file structure in `unet-server/src/`.
  * **Understated API:** The API route table is a tiny fraction of what is actually implemented. It's missing hundreds of endpoints related to the features listed above.
  * **Outdated Boot Sequence:** The `main.rs` and `server.rs` files show a much more complex initialization process involving many services that are not mentioned in the documentation.

* **`02_data_models.md` (Data Models)**
  * **Massive Schema Drift:** This is the most out-of-date document. The actual database schema is far more complex.
  * **Missing Tables:** There is no documentation for the numerous tables related to:
    * `users`, `roles`, `api_keys`, `user_roles` (Authentication).
    * `configuration_changes`, `change_audit_log`, `change_approval_workflow`, `change_rollback_snapshot` (Change Management).
    * `templates`, `template_versions`, `template_assignments`, `template_usage` (Template Engine).
    * `polling_tasks`, `interface_status` (Derived State).
  * **Incorrect Field Definitions:** As noted in the report, nearly every documented table has incorrect field names, data types (e.g., `String` vs. `UUID`, `String` vs. `i64` for timestamps), and is missing fields that exist in the code.

* **`05_cli_tool.md` (CLI Tool)**
  * **Missing Commands:** The CLI has evolved significantly and includes commands not present in the documentation, such as `config`, `export`, `import`, and `git`.
  * **Incomplete Subcommands:** The documented commands (like `node`) are missing a multitude of subcommands that exist in the code (e.g., `status`, `monitor`, `metrics`, `compare`, `polling`, `history`).
  * **Outdated Flags:** The flags and arguments for existing commands are incorrect and incomplete. For example, the `node add` command has many more options than documented.

* **`09_config_match_tool.md` (Config Match Tool)**
  * This document likely refers to the `config-slicer` crate. However, it appears to be a high-level specification. The `clippy` output revealed that `config-slicer` is a very complex crate with its own API, multiple diffing algorithms, conflict resolution, and streaming processing, none of which are detailed.

## Completely Undocumented Features

These are major features that are present in the code but have no corresponding high-level documentation file.

1. **Authentication & Authorization System:** A comprehensive system for managing users, roles, permissions, and API keys using JWTs. This is a critical security feature that is completely undocumented.
2. **Change Management & Approval Workflow:** A system for tracking, approving, rejecting, applying, and rolling back configuration changes. This is a core feature of the application that is not mentioned in the documentation.
3. **Metrics & Monitoring:** A system for collecting and exposing Prometheus metrics for system health, performance, and business logic.
4. **Network Access Control & Security:** A system for controlling access to the API based on IP address, country, and other factors. It also includes middleware for security headers and rate limiting.
5. **Configuration Encryption:** The `config_encryption.rs` file suggests a system for encrypting configuration files, which is not documented.
6. **Secrets Management:** The code includes integrations with external secret stores like AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault, which are not documented.
7. **Advanced Git Integration:** The API and CLI include features for managing Git repositories, including webhooks and change history, that go beyond the simple "git sync" described in the architecture document.

# Codebase Architecture, Features, and Layout Analysis

This analysis is based on a review of the source code and provides a more accurate picture of the project's current state than the existing documentation.

## 1. Project Layout

The actual project layout has diverged significantly from the one described in the documentation. The codebase is organized into a multi-crate workspace, but the internal structure of the crates, especially `unet-server`, is different.

* **`unet-core`:** This crate contains the core business logic, data models, and services. It appears to be the "library" crate described in the documentation, but it's much larger and more feature-rich than documented.
* **`unet-server`:** This crate contains the Axum web server and all the API handlers. Its internal structure is more complex than documented, with a `handlers` directory containing numerous files for different API resources, and several other modules for concerns like security, TLS, and background tasks.
* **`unet-cli`:** This crate contains the command-line interface. It has a `commands` directory that mirrors the feature set of the API.
* **`config-slicer`:** This is a separate, complex crate for parsing and diffing configurations, which is only briefly mentioned in the documentation.
* **`migrations`:** This crate contains the database migrations, which is consistent with the documentation.

## 2. Architecture

The project has evolved from the simple, three-tiered architecture described in the documentation into a more sophisticated, modular monolith.

* **`AppState` Pattern:** The server uses a shared `AppState` struct to manage access to the database, configuration, and various services. This is a common pattern in Axum applications, but it's not mentioned in the documentation.
* **Service-Oriented Design:** The application is broken down into several services, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., `AuthService`, `PolicyService`, `MetricsManager`). This is a good design practice, but it's not reflected in the documentation.
* **Extensive Middleware:** The server uses a rich middleware stack for handling authentication, security headers, rate limiting, logging, and more. This is a significant architectural feature that is not documented.
* **Background Tasks:** The documentation mentions a few background tasks, but the implementation in `background.rs` suggests a more robust system for managing these tasks.
* **Configuration Management:** The application uses a sophisticated configuration system that loads from a file, environment variables, and command-line arguments, with a clear precedence order. This is only briefly touched upon in the documentation.

## 3. Feature Set

The codebase includes a wide range of features that are not mentioned in the documentation at all. These features transform the project from a simple network utility into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade network automation platform.

* **Authentication and Authorization:** A complete system for user authentication (JWT-based), role-based access control (RBAC), and API key management.
* **Change Management:** A full-featured system for managing configuration changes, including approval workflows, audit trails, and rollbacks.
* **Metrics and Monitoring:** A system for collecting and exposing a wide range of metrics via Prometheus, including system health, performance, and business-level metrics.
* **Network Access Control:** A security feature that allows for fine-grained control over which IP addresses and countries can access the API.
* **TLS Certificate Management:** A system for managing TLS certificates, including rotation and health checks.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** A (currently disabled) feature for integrating with vulnerability scanners.
* **Advanced Templating:** The templating system is much more advanced than the documentation suggests, with features for validation, usage tracking, and template assignments.
* **Advanced Git Integration:** The Git integration goes far beyond simple syncing and includes features for handling webhooks and viewing change history.
* **Secrets Management:** The application includes integrations with external secret stores like AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault.

# Additional Review Areas

This section outlines further review tasks that are critical for assessing the overall quality, reliability, and security of the codebase.

## 1. Testing and Code Coverage

* **Test Execution:** The test suite could not be run due to a compilation error in the `unet-core` crate's test configuration. The error is related to unresolved imports from the `sysinfo` crate. This needs to be fixed before the test suite can be run.
* **Test Coverage:** Test coverage could not be measured because the test suite could not be run.
* **Test Quality:** A manual review of the test files shows that there are tests for many of the features, but it's not possible to assess their quality or completeness without running them.
* **Undocumented Feature Coverage:** There appear to be tests for some of the undocumented features, but a more detailed analysis is needed to determine the extent of the coverage.

## 2. Dependency and Security Audit

* **Vulnerability Scan:** The `cargo audit` command found four vulnerabilities and several unmaintained dependencies. This is a critical finding that needs to be addressed immediately.
* **Dependency Freshness:** A full review of the dependency versions has not been performed, but the presence of unmaintained dependencies suggests that other dependencies may also be out of date.

## 3. Build and Deployment Verification

* **Build Status:** The project builds successfully with `cargo build --all`.
* **Deployment Scripts:** The `Makefile` and `scripts/` directory contain build and deployment logic, but these have not been reviewed.

## Task List for Additional Review

1. **Fix Test Compilation:** Fix the compilation error in the `unet-core` crate's test configuration so that the test suite can be run.
2. **Run Test Suite:** Run the full test suite using `cargo test --all` and fix any failing tests.
3. **Measure Test Coverage:** Measure test coverage using `cargo tarpaulin` and identify areas with low coverage.
4. **Address Security Vulnerabilities:** Address the vulnerabilities found by `cargo audit` by updating the affected dependencies.
5. **Review Dependencies:** Review all dependencies for freshness and replace any that are unmaintained.
6. **Review Deployment Scripts:** Review the `Makefile` and scripts in the `scripts/` directory to ensure they are correct and up-to-date.
