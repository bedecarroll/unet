## Welcome to the ŒºNet Community

### Our Mission

ŒºNet aims to transform network configuration management through modern DevOps practices. We believe that network infrastructure should be:

- **Version controlled** like application code
- **Testable** and verifiable before deployment
- **Consistent** across environments and vendors
- **Accessible** to network engineers of all skill levels

### Community Values

**ü§ù Inclusivity**: We welcome contributors from all backgrounds and experience levels  
**üìö Learning**: We prioritize education and knowledge sharing  
**üîß Quality**: We maintain high standards while being supportive of newcomers  
**üåü Innovation**: We encourage creative solutions to networking challenges  
**üí¨ Collaboration**: We value constructive discussion and feedback  

### Ways to Contribute

You don't need to be a Rust expert to contribute! We welcome:

- **Bug reports** and feature requests
- **Documentation** improvements and examples
- **Templates** for different network vendors
- **Policies** for various compliance frameworks
- **Testing** and quality assurance
- **Community support** and answering questions
- **Code contributions** and performance improvements

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

**Rust Guidelines:**

```bash
# Format code before committing
cargo fmt

# Check for common mistakes
cargo clippy

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Check for security vulnerabilities
cargo audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo outdated
```

**Commit Message Format:**
We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(templates): add Juniper SRX firewall template

fix(policies): handle empty configuration files gracefully

docs(user-guide): add multi-vendor template examples

test(integration): add tests for policy validation
```

### Testing Requirements

**All contributions must include appropriate tests:**

**Unit Tests:**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_node_creation() {
        let node = Node::new("test-router", NodeType::Router);
        assert_eq!(node.name, "test-router");
        assert_eq!(node.node_type, NodeType::Router);
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_async_operation() {
        let result = async_function().await;
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```

**Integration Tests:**

```rust
// tests/integration_test.rs
use unet::*;

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_end_to_end_workflow() {
    // Test complete workflow from node creation to config generation
    let mut store = setup_test_store().await;
    
    let node = create_test_node(&store).await.unwrap();
    let config = generate_config(&node, "test-template").await.unwrap();
    
    assert!(config.contains("hostname test-node"));
}
```

**Template Tests:**

```yaml
# tests/templates/cisco-router.yaml
template: "cisco/router.j2"
tests:
  - name: "Basic router configuration"
    data:
      node:
        name: "test-router"
        management_ip: "192.168.1.1"
    expected_contains:
      - "hostname test-router"
      - "ip address 192.168.1.1"
```

### Code Review Process

**Pull Request Guidelines:**
