## Notes

- **Unimplemented feature docs** will be moved back to `docs/src/` when features are implemented
- **Detailed implementation docs** are preserved for developers who need deep technical details
- Current user documentation focuses on practical usage rather than implementation details

See `docs/src/roadmap.md` for current implementation status and timeline.
