//! Tests for datastore filter functions
//!
//! This module has been split into focused test modules for better organization:
//! - `node_filter_tests.rs` - Tests for node filtering and sorting functionality
//! - `location_filter_tests.rs` - Tests for location filtering and sorting functionality  
//! - `link_filter_tests.rs` - Tests for link filtering and sorting functionality
//! - `integration_tests.rs` - Tests for combined filtering and sorting operations
//! - `test_helpers.rs` - Shared test helper functions

// Tests are now organized in separate modules.
// This file serves as a placeholder to maintain backward compatibility.
// All actual tests have been moved to focused modules to keep files under 300 lines.
