## Hacker News Post

**Title:** ŒºNet {{version}} ‚Äì Open-source network configuration management in Rust

**URL:** https://github.com/example/unet/releases/tag/v{{version}}

**Suggested Comment:**

Hi HN! We've just released ŒºNet {{version}}, an open-source network configuration management and automation platform written in Rust.

ŒºNet addresses the challenge of managing network configurations at scale by providing:

- Policy-driven configuration management with a custom DSL
- SNMP monitoring and automated device discovery
- Git-based version control for network configurations
- Template engine for configuration generation
- RESTful API and CLI tools
- Multi-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)

**What's New in {{version}}:**
{{#if major_features}}
{{#each major_features}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

The core is built around a policy engine that lets you define rules like:

```
policy "interface-naming" {
  condition device.vendor == "cisco" && interface.type == "ethernet"
  action set interface.description = template("eth-{{device.location}}-{{interface.number}}")
}
```

We chose Rust for performance and reliability - network automation needs to be fast and dependable. The architecture uses SeaORM for database abstraction, Axum for the web API, and a custom parser built with Pest for the policy DSL.

Some interesting technical details:
- Async SNMP client with connection pooling
- Git integration for configuration versioning
- Template engine based on MiniJinja
- Comprehensive test suite and CI/CD

The project started as an internal tool but we decided to open-source it when we realized how useful it could be for the broader community.

Would love to get feedback from the HN community, especially around the architecture decisions and potential use cases we haven't considered.
