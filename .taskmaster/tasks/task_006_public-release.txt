# Task ID: 6
# Title: Write derived rows & delta view from SNMP collector (A-4 • P0)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Generate "derived" inventory from live SNMP data and expose mismatch diffs.
# Details:
• Create crate snmp-collector using snmp-parser + async-std.
• For each device: collect ifTable, lldpRemSysName.
• Insert rows into derived_* tables with foreign key to desired id.
• Materialize SQL VIEW v_diffs as EXCEPT between desired & derived.
• Expose REST `/api/diffs` that SELECTs view.

# Test Strategy:
Mock SNMP session with snmp-mock & assert derived rows exist.
E2E test calls REST endpoint, intentionally diverges desired state, expects diff JSON list length >0.
