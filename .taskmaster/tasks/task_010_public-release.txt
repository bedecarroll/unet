# Task ID: 10
# Title: Route-level RBAC middleware (admin vs read-only) (B-4 • P1)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enforce role-based permissions on API endpoints.
# Details:
• Define enum Role { Admin, ReadOnly }.
• Attach .layer(RequireRole::<Admin>) on mutating routes.
• Return 403 on insufficient role.
• CLI surfaces 403 as coloured error.

# Test Strategy:
User with ReadOnly attempts POST /api/nodes -> 403.
Admin succeeds.
Unit test middleware separately with axum::http::Request simulation.
