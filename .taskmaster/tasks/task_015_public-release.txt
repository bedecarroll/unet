# Task ID: 15
# Title: Cache compiled AST for large rule sets (C-5 • P1)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Persist bincode-encoded AST to disk to accelerate startup.
# Details:
• After parsing, serialize RuleSet to ~/.cache/unet/<hash>.bin.
• On next run, compare file mtime of rules; if unchanged, load cache.
• Use lru-cache for in-proc cache of 10k entries.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark startup time with and without cache; assert <10 ms for 10k rules in CI perf job using hyperfine.
