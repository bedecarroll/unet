# Task ID: 19
# Title: `unet-cli diff` command shows coloured diff (D-4 â€¢ P0)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Compare rendered template vs live config and colourize output.
# Details:
â€¢ Use similar algorithm to git diff â€“ unified.
â€¢ Use difference crate with ansi_term for colours.
â€¢ Command: `unet-cli diff --node r1 --template interfaces`.
â€¢ Fetch live config via SNMP/SSH plugin, slice via config-slicer, compare.

# Test Strategy:
Mock live config returning string; assert diff output contains `[31m-` for deletions.
Exit code 2 when diff present.
