# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement canary workflow `push-canary` (E-2 • P1)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Push rendered configs to staging devices.
# Details:
• `unet-cli push-canary <dir>` iterates rendered files, pushes via NETCONF/SSH to devices tagged canary.
• Waits for health check; rolls back on error.

# Test Strategy:
Integration test mocks SSH push using assert_cmd with fake server; checks rollback path triggered on failure code.
